# Test & Main Networks

The `regtest` mode is convenient for local development, but it comes a time when you want to test your smart contracts and DApp on the real network.

# Connecting To The Testnet

The docker container connects to different networks depending on which `RECRYPT_NETWORK` is specified. By default, `regtest` is used. To connect to the test network, use `testnet`:

```
docker run -it --rm \
  --name myapp \
  -e "RECRYPT_NETWORK=testnet" \
  -v `pwd`:/dapp \
  -p 9899:9899 \
  -p 9888:9888 \
  -p 3889:3889 \
  -p 13888:13888 \
  hayeah/recryptportal
```

* `-p 13888:13888` is the p2p port for the testnet, so other nodes can connect to you.

It takes some time to download the blockchain data from the network. You'll see log messages like this stream by:

```

```

* `progress` approaches 1.0 (100%) as your local node catch up to the network.
* `height` the latest block that had been synced.

Visit the [Testnet Block Explorer](https://testnet.recrypt.org/) to see some stats about the test network. In particular, it lists the latest blocks mined, so you can get a rough idea of how far along you are in the synchronization process:

As of Mid-December 2017, the block height is about 50,000ish.

## Getting Testnet Tokens

For the testnet you are not allowed to generate or mine new blocks to get tokens. Rather, you can request some free tokens from the testnet faucet:

http://testnet-faucet.recrypt.info

First generate a new payment address:

```
qcli getnewaddress

qcf3Yv72SbLvVDmU99BMf5T1YwvdvA3fx6
```

Then copy it into the input box:

![](networks/faucet.jpg)

http://testnet-faucet.recrypt.info

Once accepted, you should see your address and amount in the list of latest payouts:

![](networks/faucet-paid.jpg)

Clicking on the pay out address, you'd see a link to view the transaction in the testnet block explorer:

![](networks/faucet-pay-tx.jpg)

[https://testnet.recrypt.org/address/qcf3Yv72SbLvVDmU99BMf5T1YwvdvA3fx6](https://testnet.recrypt.org/address/qcf3Yv72SbLvVDmU99BMf5T1YwvdvA3fx6)

Tapping ctrl-r madly to refresh the browsers again and again, because it'll help the network to confirm the transaction faster. Once it's confirmed, you can check your balance locally:

```
qcli getbalance

94.00000000
```

You can also see the UTXOs created for that amount:

```
qcli listunspent

[
  {
    "txid": "2a8997d398633bc01c97fc623a59aaca4f678caf2d3949f4679e1f0f5952479f",
    "vout": 0,
    "address": "qcf3Yv72SbLvVDmU99BMf5T1YwvdvA3fx6",
    "account": "",
    "scriptPubKey": "76a914d17c851679a8ca558d9d783643cc926f7a382e7888ac",
    "amount": 94.00000000,
    "confirmations": 23,
    "spendable": true,
    "solvable": true
  }
]
```

But sorry, there's no http://faucet.recrypt.info : p

# Main Network

To connect to the mainnet, set `RECRYPT_NETWORK=mainnet`:

```
docker run -it --rm \
  --name myapp \
  -e "RECRYPT_NETWORK=mainnet" \
  -v `pwd`:/dapp \
  hayeah/recryptportal
```

Note that we've omitted the `-p` flags, so the network ports are not accessible outside the container.

It's safer to do your things by shelling into the container:

```
docker exec -it myapp sh
```
